                            <h3>Why does interval training work?</h3><br><!-- <strong class="price"><small>$</small>75</strong> -->                            
                            <div>
										<p>We are all probably aware of the benefits of interval training - its considered superior to constant intensity workouts for building stamina, improving fitness and fat loss. In fact research has shown that Tabata - which is a form of intense interval training - can burn as much calories via a four minute routine as an hour of cycling. 
All sounds very good and numerous studies have confirmed that interval training does work. But what's the science behind interval training workouts.</p>
<p> 
Let's start with the basics - how does our body burn fat. Our body stores energy in the form of fat as a safety mechanism against adverse periods where the body may not get sufficient fuel. The survival instincts of the body mean that we are predisposed to store fat. That's why my basic theory that if you want to burn fat then your ‘calories out’ has to be greater than ‘calories in’.</p> 										
										</div>
										<div id="blog1-more">
										<p>But we should not forget that our body is the most perfect machine ever created. If you reduce calories in - it adapts and lowers the metabolic rate. Even if you do the same exercise everyday the body adapts and the benefits of exercise start plateauing out.
 </p>
<p>Fat is stored as triglycerides in the fat cells - which when in need gets converted to fatty acids which can be oxidised by our body. Given the fact that the body is evolved to preserve energy it uses two mechanisms to slow down fat burn - adapting to a new exercise or diet regime and second producing lactic acid while exercising which naturally slows down exercising capacity of the muscles.
 </p>
<p>Interval training addresses both the mechanisms. It combines short bursts of high intensity training along with periods of rest. Since the body is alternating between high and low intensity workouts it 'confuses' the muscles - preventing the body from adapting to the workout.
 </p>
<p>HIIT combines anaerobic and aerobic periods of exercise. In the anaerobic period the body is starved of oxygen and hence it burns the fat in the body. While in the aerobic period the body refuels with oxygen. Normally, the body fights long periods of anaerobic activity by forming lactic acid in the muscles which causes them to become sore and slow down.
 </p>
<p>However, when we are doing interval training, the high intensity part helps to breakdown triglycerides and burn fat, while the low intensity part prevents the formation of lactic acid. Thus the body can burn fat for longer periods of time. And since the muscles are not able to adapt to the change in intensity, the body does not fight the burning of fat.
 </p>
<p>The other effect is the after-burn. Put simply it means that the body can continue burning calories even after the exercise. Studies have shown that both interval training and resistance training are far superior to plain running or cycling in burning more calories after the exercise.
 </p>
 <p>
So next time you plan a gym session, go for circuit training or HIIT and melt away those fat cells !!</p>

                            <h3>Should woman do weight training?</h3><br><!-- <strong class="price"><small>$</small>75</strong> -->                            
                            <div>
										<p>The question faces most of the regular women gym goers - with lots of reasons being cited as to why they should not. You don’t want to bulk, it might destroy your figure, it can cause back pain and other injuries, its bad for the joints and so on. Thus a large portion of women stick to pilates, yoga and running.
 
The benefits of weight training, particularly as women age, far outweigh cardio training. Here are some reasons why weight training is good for women</p> 										
										</div>
										<div id="blog2-more">
										<ul>
										<li>You will not bulk up: Despite the misconceptions, the hormonal differences between men and women mean that resistance training does not imply then women will bulk up. Yes you will gain lean muscle and improve muscle tone, but you’ll need to take supplements or spend hours in the gym to really bulk up</li>
<li>Weight training will add to your curves: With weight training you improve muscle tone and lose fat - perfect for your figure. With cardio or diet regime you would loose muscle as well as fat - not so good for the curves</li>
<li>Resistance training is better for loosing weight: Numerous studies have shown that resistance training is superior to cardio for after-burn - implying that your body can burn calories for longer after you finish exercising. And more muscle mass means that the body’s metabolic rate increases - hence more fat burn</li>
<li>It improves bone density: Regular weight training strengthens the bones and improves bond density - particularly important for women as they age. It reduces the risk of osteoporosis.</li>
<li>It keeps the heart healthy: Studies have reported that regular weight training reduces risks of heart disease. It has been shown that the blood pressure levels are lower among weight training subjects the following day compared to pure cardio training</li>
<li>Reduces stress level: While any form of exercise has been associated with reduced stress levels, it has been shown that people who weight train regularly can manage stressful situations better than those who don’t</li>
<li>It lowers the risk of injury: Stronger muscles and give more support to your joints reducing the risk of any injury. Make sure you do the exercises properly. Check the exercise videos at trainmefit.co.uk for exercise videos to do weight training with the correct form.</li>

                            <h3>Choosing the right facial</h3><br><!-- <strong class="price"><small>$</small>75</strong> -->                            
                            <div>
										<p>Going to a spa is pure bliss - time to relax and unwind. Last weekend, while visiting one of the spas just outside London, I decided to opt for a facial treatment. The jargon of the treatments on offer was mind boggling - lots of ‘re’ in the descriptions: relaxing, rejuvenating, refreshing, rehydrating, revitalising, rebalancing, renewing, relieving, regenerating, restoring just to name a few. This got me brooding on what is the right facial for me? 
										
First the basics - the objective of a facial treatment is to improve skin tone and make you feel pampered and relaxed. It removes the dead cells from the skin, nourishes the face and leaves your skin glowing and healthy.
 </p> 										
										</div>
										<div id="blog3-more">
										<p>For many people, including me, the objective of a facial is to be pampered and have a healthier skin. However for some the objectives may differ based on
You want a deep cleanse of the skin
Your skin is blotchy and tired and you want an even skin tone
You want to rehydrate the skin
You want to fight those signs of ageing and want to firm and lift the skin
 </p>
 <p>
So what facial should you choose?
 
Almost all facials will involve the basis steps - cleansing, exfoliating, a mask, a moisturizer and massage of the face and neck. Luxury facials would typically be for longer and involve multiple masks and more pampering massage of the face, neck and shoulders. The key to choose the right facial is a) your current skin condition b) the kind of mask you want and c) whether to go for steaming and extraction.
 
If your aim is a deep cleanse, go for facials that include words like detox, refresh, revitalise or maybe some form of oxygen treatment. Choose a mask that is deep cleansing and you may opt for blackhead removal exfoliation. Some spas offer oxygen jets which would help to cleanse your skin.
 
If you are prone to acne, be careful about using the classic lotions as these can cause a breakout. Instead go for a cleanser with salicylic acid, a clay mask, and a lactic acid peel. Make sure the therapist avoids scrubs; applying these can irritate the skin
 
To improve skin tone and rehydrate the skin opt for moisturising masks. Longer exfoliation would be good for promoting an even skin tone.
 
To fight wrinkles, pick a facial with a little extra exfoliation. Glycolic, lactic, and enzyme peels are all great ways to get rid of that layer of dead skin that makes pores look larger and wrinkles look deeper. For dull skin, look for a facial that combines a mild peel and brightening ingredients such as vitamin C or kojic acid.
 
Lastly, extraction and steaming has become very popular to remove blotches and pimply spots on the skin. Steaming softens the pores, allowing extraction to work. My advice, do not use an extractor machine as these can cause discolorations. Instead ask the therapist to use a gauze - but avoid too much pressure as it can break the capillaries. Finally if you have very dry skin or eczema skip the steaming as it can exacerbate the condition and use a warm cloth instead
 
 
Whatever your reason for going for a facial, sit back relax and feel thoroughly pampered !!

                            <h3>The Myth of ‘fat free’, ‘sugar free’ and ‘gluten free’ diets</h3><br><!-- <strong class="price"><small>$</small>75</strong> -->                            
                            <div>
										<p>In today’s busy lifestyle, we do our best to remain fit and healthy. A number of ‘free’ diets have sprung up - gluten free, sugar free, fat free, lactose free. While some of these are beneficial for people with intolerance, a number of them are more marketing strategies - its not entirely obvious that they are good.</p>
										<p>Just because a food is labelled fat free - its may not superior to a more ‘normal’ product that has fat in it. A number of studies have shown that moderate amount of fat is good for you. The first question is what kid of fat are you eating - monounsaturated fats are actually beneficial for the body - fish oils, fats from nuts and fruits like avocado contain essential oils and nutrients that keep your body healthy. 

The second question is what has been substituted to make the product fat free. Often the carbohydrate content has been increased to substitute for fat - which may do more harm than good. Adding artificial sweeteners again - does more harm than good. Unless you have a medical condition - don’t go for sweeteners. Or the amount of processed food may be higher in ‘fat free’ products - again it may be doing more harm than good.

A similar case can be made for sugar free or gluten free products. Lets compare some of the common misconceptions of ‘free’ products that we often consume
</p> 										
										</div>
										<div id="blog4-more">										
<p>
Sugar free 'diet' drinks

It’s been well documented that fizzy drinks are not good for your health. However, if one wants to have a coke - is it better to have a ‘diet’ one or as one of friends call a ‘full fat one’.

Its not obvious which is a better choice. While having a ‘diet’ cola does avoid refined sugar intake, some studies have shows that having sweeteners may increase your sugar cravings. So overall your daily consumption of sugar may actually go up. Other studies have shown that some sweeteners may be carcinogenic though the research appears inconclusive. Diet soda contains the same amount of acid as a regular one - which harms your teeth and your body ph balance. In a study involving 2465 subjects over 9 years, scientists found that regular consumption of diet soda increased risk of heart stroke by 48%.

Conclusion: Moderation is the key. Don’t fool yourself that having a ‘diet’ soda means that you’re going for the healthier option
</p>
<p>
Gluten free diets

While gluten free is becoming the new fad diet - we must understand what exactly gluten free means. Gluten is a form of protein found in wheat, rye and barley. So going gluten free is giving up the consumption of predominantly wheat and wheat based products. The good thing - most processed foods are based on wheat and sugar - cakes, pastries, white bread - all of which contribute to weight gain. So if you’re on a gluten free diet you give up all these.

However, unless you are gluten intolerant or have been advised by your doctor to avoid gluten - all the gluten free diet is providing a framework to avoid processed food. Something that can be achieved by a healthy diet and less complications.

Beware of substitutes that go for a gluten free diet. Sometimes it could be processed corn - again not obvious thats good for you

Conclusion: Unless the doctor advises, gluten free diet is just a framework for avoiding processed food. Something that can be done with much more easily with a balanced diet
</p>
<p>
<b>Fat free foods</b>

Walk along a super store and food with labels of ‘fat free’, ‘low fat’, ‘reduced fat’ pop up. Some of it is good - skinny latte retains most of the goodness of milk, while cutting down on fat. But in some cases to make products low fat - substitutes include sugar, thickeners and strange it may sound but salt - all of which can do more harm than good. 

Our body needs fat - a healthy diet should have 30% of our body energy via fat. The key is to differentiate between good and bad fat. 

Good fats include both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.Monounsaturated fats (like olive oils) lower the LDL "bad cholesterol" in the bloodstream and raise the amount of HDL "good cholesterol." Polyunsaturated fats found in fatty fish such as tuna and salmon also help lower LDL cholesterol.

Bad fats include saturated fat (found in animal products like beef, pork) artificial trans fats, found in partially hydrogenated oils.

Key to healthy diet is to encourage healthy fats in the diet - nuts, fish, olive oil are all good for you.
<b>Conclusion:<b> Don't go for fat free food products, choose good fat products. And if you feel like a treat sometimes, don't feel guilty - just keep it in moderation.

                            <div>
										<p>Hit the wrong side of 30 and we start worrying about wrinkles on the face. Today, there is so much research dedicated to anti wrinkle creams which means a plethora of products to suit your age and skin tone. I am not going to advocate the virtues of any one brand but focus on how we can make small changes to our lifestyle which could delay the onset of wrinkles by at least a few years.</p>
										<p>The person who has impressed me most in terms of beauty tips was my grandmother. In her years, there were hardly any anti wrinkle creams or complicated procedures that could enhance the skin appearance. Yet, she managed to always look far younger than her years and was a source of energy and vitality around the house. The secret: simple lifestyle and home based remedies

Some simple changes we all can make to our lifestyle to protect our skin
</p> 										
										</div>
										<div id="blog6-more">
										
<ul>
<li>Avoid too much exposure to the sun: Beach holidays are great but never step out without an SPF. And remember that its not just the direct exposure to the sun that harms the skin, but indirect exposure as well</li>
<li>Avoid suntan beds: Its the modern day craze to go for tanning sessions. The UV rays can wreck havoc on your poor skin cells. Opt for spray tan solutions instead. If you want it to get it done properly at home, use a qualified therapist from beautyhome.co.uk</li>
<li>Give up smoking: The harmful effects of smoking are not limited to your lungs, it increases free radicals in the body which harms the skin. Even passive smoking can harm your skin</li>
<li>Avoid yo-yo dieting: Rapid weight losses or weight gains results in loss of elasticity of the skin. Its the supple nature of the skin that gives it the youthful look</li>
<li>Eat natural: Plenty of fruits and vegetables - in particular food rich in Vitamin A,C, E and K - in simple terms green leafy vegetable and fruits that are orange and red in colour. And switch red meat to fish. Fish oils are rich in Omega 3 which is great for the skin</li>
<li>Drink plenty of water: Probably half my beauty tips include drinking more water. Its the source of life and helps to flush out toxins from our body</li>
<li>Get lots of sleep: You body needs time to recover and replace the dead cells on the skin. At least 7 hours a day and more on weekends !!</li>
<li>Pamper your skin regularly: Get a facial atleast once every 20 days, which is the body cycle time to replace dead cells. Try luxury facials at your home from beautyhome.co.uk</li>
<li>Smile a lot: Best thing you can do to avoid wrinkles. Laughter is the best medicine :))</li>

                            <div>
										<p>Many of us have face this dilemma - we start a gym routine with all the good intentions (mostly in January after the festivities) - spend hours on the treadmill or the cross trainer but find that our weight refuses to budge !! A number of factors could be holding you back ...</p>
										<ol>
	<li>Exercise cannot outweigh an unhealthy diet
If you want a washboard stomach and six pack - start with focussing on your diet. Many of us wrongly believe that just because we go to the gym, it gives us an excuse to eat more. Remember the simple equation of 
calories in - calories out 										
										</div>
										<div id="blog7-more">										
										

If you want to loose weight, you can either increase your calorie out (by exercising) or reduce your calories in. But if you increase your calories in, your weight may not shift much.</li>
	<li>Eat the right kind of food
Processed food and sugar is the death knell of six packs. Go natural in your food and avoid processed sugar.
A friend of mine started going to the gym but because he had read somewhere that athletes load up on carbs - he increased his carb intake. Don't forget athletes who need to increase carb intake probably exercise 5-6 hours a day, not 2-3 hours a week</li>
	<li>Try to increase your resting metabolism
Eat a healthy breakfast and light dinner. It will keep you energetic throughout the day. Increase proteins in the diet while cutting down on carbs. And have plenty of fruits and vegetables. They're full of natural goodness that your body needs.</li>
	<li>Focus on your sleep
Too little sleep and your body does not get a chance to recover. Any adverse situation and the body does what evolution has taught it to do - conserve energy. So aim to get at least 7 hours of sleep a day. It'll also do wonders for your gorgeous looks</li>
	<li>Do the right exercise
First of all any exercise is better than no exercise. Walking is great for loosing weight. But if you're serious about changing your figure aim for the afterburn so that your body can keep burning calories even after you stop exercising. HIIT workouts and resistance training are way superior than spending time on the treadmill. Try sites like trainmefit.co.uk to get a personalised workout at a fraction of cost</li>
	<li>Cut down on stress
High stress levels are associated with all the negative connotations. You eat and drink more when stressed. Stress also effects your sleep patterns and slows down your metabolism. And let's face it - you are not giving your exercise 100% if your mind is not at ease. Try meditation and yoga classes. Make more friends and smile more often - for life is just beautiful !!</li>

                            <div>
										<p>Beauty treatments are a quintessential part of every woman’s life. Its estimated that an average British woman spends over £140,000 over her lifetime in beauty treatments (and that does not include any cosmetic treatments). And beauty treatments are no longer the domain of the fairer sex – treatments including manicure, pedicure and massage are fast gaining popularity among men.</p>
										<p>In the UK, the mobile beauty treatment industry has been far lagging behind. In Asia, home beauty treatments are the norm while even in the US, it is estimated that about a fourth of beauty treatments are done at home. In the UK the statistics is close to one in twenty – arguing that the mobile beauty therapy industry is expected to explode over the coming years.</p> 										
										</div>
										<div id="blog8-more">										
<p>
The benefits of home beauty treatments are obvious to see. You are not constrained by the quality of the salons near the house. And if you have the travel a bit far – the hassle of finding a parking space or struggling in a public transport defeats the purpose of getting some pampering treatment. Imagine getting a nice manicure only to find yourself in a jam packed sweaty tube on the way home!! For a working professional most salons are closed by the time you reach home and not many are open on weekends. And if you are a mum with young kids, pregnant or not feeling too well – a mobile beauty therapist can be a life saver.
</p> 
<p>  
No wonder a host of mobile beauty companies have been offering home visit services. The most successful London mobile beauty companies include BeautyHome (beautyhome.co.uk), Spa by car and Return to Glory. Some specialist therapy companies like themassagerooms provide one specific therapy service while companies like beautyhome.co.uk offer a variety of treatments ranging from make-up, manicure, pedicure and massage treatments.
</p> 
<p> 
The question is how to choose the right mobile beauty company. Of course trial and error works but the no one wants to go through the disappointment of getting a sub-par treatment. My recommendations would be
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Go through the companies’ website – a professional website speaks volumes about the quality of the company</li>
	<li>Look for the number of therapists – if the company has just one or two therapist – chances are that the company is struggling</li>
	<li>Check for references – a therapy company that has been involved in corporate events is likely to be successful and offers good quality (for example Perfect10 was mentioned in the Elle magazine, beautyhome.co.uk was involved in the cosmopolitan summer party)</li>
	<li>Always look for positive testimonials from satisfied customers as well as reviews on the net</li>
</ul>                              
<p>Good luck to all in trying to find the best beauty therapists!!</p>

                            <h3>Rise of the male grooming</h3><br><!-- <strong class="price"><small>$</small>75</strong> -->                            
                            <div>
										<p>A perfect gentleman is always well groomed, oozing effortless charm with impeccable manners and brimming with confidence. Gone are the days when beauty treatments were the realm of the fairer sex - the metrosexual man is as conscious of his looks as the women of today. Be it the perfect haircut, well groomed hands or just a relaxing massage, men are now using beauty treatments more than ever.</p>
										<p>The most popular beauty treatments for men include massage, spray tans and waxing, though manicures and pedicures are fast becoming popular.</p> 										
										</div>
										<div id="blog9-more">																				 
<p>In todays sedentary lifestyle, sitting for over 10 hours a day can take its toll on our backs. And most of us don’t really have the right postures while sitting in front of a computer. The result - knotted backs and lower back pains. Experts like BeautyHome recommends a massage session every two weeks to prevent back pains from becoming a chronic pain. If your muscles are sore, opt for a Swedish or deep tissue massage to relieve the stress.
My favourite place to spend the weekend would be head to a spa resort. Of course its not feasible to do it every other week - treats should be special !! But to give your back the much needed pampering, book one of the friendly beauty therapist from a mobile beauty company likebeautyhome.co.uk or other massage companies.
</p> 
<p>Manicures and pedicures are becoming also fast popular among men. One of my friends used to say that for men its a bit odd to go to a salon to get a beauty treatment as you’re likely to be only male in the salon. I can empathise - and hence the need for mobile beauty companies that can cater for men as well. I was very impressed last week when I saw a flyer from beautyhome.co.uk listing treatments only for men. At least some companies are recognising the rise of the male grooming. 
</p>
<p>Waxing of chest, back and shoulders is another area where the menfolk are taking to beauty treatments. Waxing gives a cleaner, smooth look which is easier on the eye. 
For the novices, a few tips when booking a waxing treatment</p>
<ul>
	<li>It is advisable to wear loose fitting clothing after a waxing session to avoid the skin becoming irritated. Also, tight fitting clothing on freshly waxed areas can contribute to painful ingrown hairs.</li>
	<li>Avoid too much sun exposure for about 48 hours after a waxing session as the skin is sensitive.</li>
	<li>The wax needs really needs to adhere closely to the skin, so don’t put oil or lotion on the area prior to the treatment.</li>
	<li>Avoid waxing over irritated, sunburned, or infected skin. You should also avoid the use of hot tubs, swimming pools or direct application of soaps and perfumes on the treated area after a waxing session.</li>
</ul> 
   
<p>Happy grooming to all the men folk !! you deserve every bit of pampering as the fairer sex</p>

                            <h3>The many benefits of fasting</h3><br><!-- <strong class="price"><small>$</small>75</strong> -->                            
                            <div>
										<p>Over recent years, the health community has taken to the idea of fasting. Diets like the 5:2 diets have gained in popularity which advocate fasting (read as less than 25% of your normal calorie intake) for 2 days and eating a normal diet for the remaining 5 days. Health spas which encourage people to fast and enjoy a healthy week of yoga and detox are fast gaining popularity.</p> 										
										</div>
										<div id="blog10-more">
										<p>The concept of fasting is definitely not new - infact it is something that almost all religions advocate - Christianity advocates the concept of lent which typically involves giving up something on the food side (more likely than not to be alcohol or chocolates or crisps - and hence helps to detox the body).  Islam advocates fasting for the month of Ramadan. Hinduism has various references of fasting and ancient yogic scriptures have advocated one day of only fruits and vegetables diet. 
Probably the religious doctrines knew more about the human body than we do - probably an effect of the technology era we live in which effectively distances our thinking process from what our body is telling us.  
A number of researches have verified the positive aspects of fasting - from the most intuitive ones of aiding in weight loss, but more importantly to help is various diseases including arthritis, blood pressure and even making your skin gorgeous and beautiful.</p>
<p>So how does fasting help</p> 
 <ul>
	<li>The simplest benefit of fasting in reducing the calorie intake. To me the essence of various diets is calories in - calories out. If you want to loose weight, either reduce the calories in or increase calories out. Simple things in life are good</li>
	<li>Fasting is the best way to detox the body. Lets face it - despite our best efforts, we can’t avoid processed food - something that our body is not really used to. So a day (or two) of fasting gives our digestive system the much needed rest and helps to eliminate the toxins from the body</li>
	<li>Fasting promotes better eating. When you switch over a day of dietary requirements to fruits, vegetables and other natural stuff - you’re taking in a lot of nutrients - something that you may have generally avoided. One of my colleagues skilfully avoids any leaves that come along with his main course.</li>
	<li>It helps your skin as well. Lower levels of free radicals and toxins in the body implies better skin tone. Not only that, with the digestive system given a bit of rest, the body can focus energy in regenerating other parts of the body - including not just the internal organs but also the dead skin cells.</li>
	<li>Recent researches have shown the benefits of fasting beyond the above obvious points. It has been shown to slow the onset of Alzheimers, cancer and heart diseases.</li>
	<li>During fasting, the brain releases protein called BDNF which activates production of new neurons. This protein also protects your brain cells from changes associated with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease</li>
	<li>Regular fasting removes free radicals from the body which have been associated with increased risks of cancer. It also improves the immune system. Remember that in most of the animal kingdom - when they are sick, the natural tendency is to stop eating and letting the body repair itself</li>
	<li>Strange it may sound but fasting can lead to increased energy levels. Once the body overcomes the initial stages of change in eating pattern, the energy used up in the digestive system is diverted to rest of the body making the mind clearer and feeling more energetic</li>
</ul>
 
<p>So go ahead and give your body the detox it deserves. I am in no way advocating a too low eating habit which can be characterised as close to being anorexic.  I am a natural foodie and love eating. But once in a while, its good to give the body a break from the daily routine of eating.</p>
 
<p>Also remember that nutrition is just one aspect of healthy living. Regular exercise is as important. So east a healthy diet and exercise regularly. And if you need an additional help is getting the right exercise routine, use sites like trainmefit.co.uk which can provide a personalised workouts at affordable costs.</p>

                            <div>
										<p>Summer is here !!! Outdoors, the sun, skirts and sleeveless dresses and the beach !! We all cant wait to enjoy the holidays and outdoor activities. With summer clothes that make us all look gorgeous - its time to show off ! Below is our list of 10 beauty tips to make heads turn around when you walk. And remember our skin is more exposed to the elements so we need to take extra care !</p>
										<ul>
										<li>Be generous with your sunscreen: Exposure to the sun may not be limited to lying on the beach or by the pool, even heading out for an afternoon may result in discolouration of the skin</li> 										
										</div>
										<div id="blog11-more">										
										<li>Drink plenty of water: While it may seem obvious but our skin needs all the hydration it can get. 8-10 glasses a day at a minimum during the summer months</li>
										<li>If you do get sun burns, ice cold compress can cool your skin. And if you need a bit of extra help go for hydrocortisone creams (biafine)</li>
										<li>If you want that gorgeous tanned skin look, go for spray tan (BeautyHome recommends fake bake) rather than endless sessions on the sun bed. Too much exposure to UV can damage your skin</li>
										<li>Heading for the beach but hate waxing around the bikini area - try Hot Wax. Much less painful for the sensitive parts - and hey no pain, no gain !</li>
										<li>Beautify skin from within with plenty of fruits and vegetables high in Vitamins A and C and natural estrogens. Broccoli and sweet potatoes are high in natural estrogens and work wonders to your skin</li>
										<li>Blemishes and pimples on your skin - use a gycolic or salycic acid based cleanser and make sure that whatever you apply on your skin - from makeup to moisturisers is oil free. And always remember to remove your makeup before heading off to bed</li>
										<li>Exfoliating your skin becomes even more important during the summer months. Beauty home recommends exfoliating 2-3 times a week. A face mask with natural ingredients would leave your skin glowing and gorgeous</li>
										<li>If you thought dry lips were a thing for winters, think again ! Go for lip balms and glosses with soothing ingredients like shea butter - and SPF is a must</li>
										<li>Your body needs a treat from time to time. Go on and pamper yourself. And if your busy lifestyle does not offer you much time, try mobile  beauty therapy companies like beautyhome.co.uk where therapists can come to your home late evening or weekends !</li>

                            <div>
										<p>I love travelling - new cultures, meeting different people, trying their cuisines and there’s always something positive to learn. Got a bit of a break from my grilling schedule and spent a weekend in Seoul, Korea.</p> 										
										</div>
										<div id="blog12-more">										
										<p>I am at a loss of words to describe the city - its simply amazing !! A city buzzing with life and a city of contrasts. Its steeped in culture and the people are extremely polite and welcoming. Yet its as modern as any European city. Technology wise probably more advanced - almost everywhere there is a wifi connection and one can see people with the latest gadgets in their hands. I’ve been told that the per person consumption of alcohol is one of the highest in the world and if you go to a club, be prepared to last till at least the early hours of the morning.
</p>
<p>But what struck me about the Koreans is that they all seem so fit and skinny. It was almost impossible to find anyone who one could categorise as fat - forget the obese category. Yet at every two minutes one would find a coffee shop selling mouth watering desserts - and one could see Koreans not being shy about eating.
</p> 
<p>So what's the secret about Koreans being so fit and skinny (a disclaimer - my observations purely stem from seeing people in Seoul). Got chatting with some of the guests at the hotel and a bit of web searching later, some interesting observations
</p>
<ul>
	<li>People are extremely conscious about  with their looks and figure. No wonder their figures look toned and skin super healthy</li>
	<li>Diet is dominated by sea food and very little fried stuff forms part of the meal.</li>
	<li>Despite an abundance of shops catering for desserts, Korean diet has very little processed food. The concept of Organic is gaining more popularity in the west - but we forget that for most of Asia, the main diet has always been very close to natural organic stuff.</li>
	<li>Korean diet consists of lots of vegetables. Almost every meal has an abundance of vegetables</li>
	<li>Koreans are extremely emotional people with very strong family ties. A number of researches have shown that surrounding yourself with people makes one healthier and happier in life.</li>
	<li>Lots of friends and family around makes you a social eater - where you tend to watch what you eat and in general eat less. One thing I noticed that most of the people eating in the restaurants were in groups rather than in twos.</li>
	<li>The serving portions are smaller - even smaller than London and way smaller than the US. I ordered a steak with mashed potatoes and felt was a bit hungry even after my meal :)</li>
</ul> 
<p>
While I am not an advocate of being obsessed with looks or figure, there a number is things one can learn from the east - more vegetables, less processed food and a more social lifestyle can perhaps make us healthier and happier !

                            <h3>Face cleanser</h3><br><!-- <strong class="price"><small>$</small>75</strong> -->                            
                            <div>
										<p>Washing one’s face is a daily routine; it is pretty simple which should be done twice during the day in the morning and at night. A morning cleansing is beneficial; as it removes any toxins the skin eliminates during the night and refreshes the skin, preparing it for make-up application. It is</p> 										
										</div>
										<div id="blog13-more">
											<p> important to cleanse your skin every night to remove make-up, impurities, dead skin cells, and excess oil.</p>
<p> For the removal of eye make-up, especially waterproof mascara, there are particular products specifically formulated for the eye area. However, some gentle facial cleansers can effectively remove all make-up, eye, and facial, as well as cleanse the skin. Use an oil free cleanser for oily skin, and a milky or creamy cleanser for drier skin types.
</p>
<p>
	The original use of a toner is to return the skin's pH back to normal. It is also useful to complete the cleansing process, as it will remove any last traces of make-up and cleanser residue. Some toners have very beneficial ingredients that help certain skin conditions. As an example, ethanol will help with excess oil, whereas lactic acid or other alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) will help exfoliate and smooth the skin's texture.</p>
											<p>This is one of the most important parts of your daily skin care routine, because toner lowers the skins pH level, calms the skin and helps prepare it for any of the night creams or serums that will follow. It also helps to balance the skin after cleansing and before applying a moisturising cream. </p>
											<p>Don’t skip the moisturizer as your skin needs to be replenished each night. Don’t forget to moisturise your lips as the skin over the lips is thinner than anywhere else on the face. Use a strong emollient-based product each night to keep your lips plump and moist. Along with the lips, don’t forget to hydrate the eye zone, with a very light product which is designed for this.</p>
<p>A word of advice! It is important to choose moisturisers that include natural ingredients such as shea butter, cocoa butter, aloe vera, jojoba, rosehip, ginseng, seaweed and pure essential oils. These botanical extracts and oils helps to improve skin elasticity, texture, clarity, fine lines and wrinkles.

                            <h3>Facial Scrub</h3><br><!-- <strong class="price"><small>$</small>75</strong> -->                            
                            <div>
								<p>A good facial scrub helps to maintain the glow on your complexion and to avoid your blackheads growing.</p>
<p>A face scrub is an exfoliation product which has been designed specifically for use on the face. The face sees a lot of wear and tear; it requires special attention when it comes to skincare. For this reason, it is important to use scrubs marked for use on the face in facial care, rather than generic exfoliating scrubs.</p> 										
										</div>
										<div id="blog14-more">
											<p> Facial scrubs make way for new skin beneath every day. It helps to unclog pores from dirt, blackheads, dead skin and other surface impurities so that new, healthy skin may flourish.  Exfoliation is considered one of the most important techniques that you can perform on your skin to resolve certain skin problems as well as to achieve healthy and glowing skin.</p>
<p>There are two types of exfoliant "chemical" or "acid" and “physical.”  In the chemical or acid exfoliant, you apply it, leave it on the skin, and it works to dissolve the dry skin cells. These exfoliant include ingredients such as Glycolic Acid, AHAs and BHA, and enzymes such as Pumpkin, Papaya, and Pineapple.  In a “physical" exfoliant you have to do the work. These exfoliant include facial brushes, sponges, and facial scrubs.</p>
											<p>The benefits of exfoliation</p>
											<p>Exfoliation helps to destroy acne-causing bacteria as it tends to dry out the skin and prevents future breakouts. It clears the red, dark marks that remain on the skin long after the breakout has healed. The key to fading those post-breakout marks is to increase your exfoliation. The result is more even-toned skin with less scarring.</p>
											<p>It clears clogged pores. Clogged pores are basically blackheads, whiteheads, and little clogged bumps on the skin, often on the forehead.  The more you exfoliate; it will remove surface dry skin cells. As a result, less oil will stay trapped and congested in the pores.</p>
											<p>These are brown spots that come from age, pregnancy, hormonal changes, and genetics. Exfoliation is beneficial for breaking up the pigmented cells to allow them to fade. </p>
											<p>Exfoliation is very important during the winter months. Exfoliate to remove the dry skin cells, and then moisturize the new skin cells, resulting in a moister skin.</p>

								<p>Winter months are really harsh on your skin! During this season the skin tends to become dry, flaky and patchy. It is vitally important to look after your skin at this time of year. You go through your usual skincare routine at home, but a facial is needed to give your skin a boost. For that, a hydrating facial is a must!</p> 										
										</div>
										<div id="blog15-more">
											<p> This facial is designed to hydrate and heal skin on a deep level. Hydrating facial is best for dry skin and is a natural anti-aging solution. Moreover, after the facial your skin will be smooth and leave you with a really clean feeling.</p>
											<p>The first step to this hydrating facial is cleaning and toning. It is followed by a peel that is gently massaged into the skin. The peel helps to get rid of all dead skin cells from the face. The next step is a facial massage, followed by a steamer to gently steam the face.</p> 
											<p>Next, it is time for extraction. While it's not the most pleasant part of any facial, and optional with this particular facial, it is of course hugely beneficial for your skin to get rid of any blackheads. However, one shouldn't ever try to extract blackheads without first steaming the skin as it can leave marks on the face.</p>
											<p>The next part of the facial is far more enjoyable, Hydrating Kit is used to get the skin back in good shape and prepare it for the cold spell ahead. The Hydrating Kit consists of a Hydrating Modelling Cream, a Super Hydrating Mask and an Activation Gel.</p> 
											<p>The Hydrating Modelling Cream is gently massaged deep into the skin and then the Super Hydrating Mask is applied. Then the activation gel is applied which helps all the products to penetrate into the pores.</p>
<p>Recommended for dry or dehydrated skin, the hydrating facial promises to leave the skin moisturised with a healthy glow. It certainly does just that and more! , the benefits of the hydrating facial are long lasting and help one to be prepared for the cold weeks ahead!</p>
